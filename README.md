# Simple Interactions demo

This is the demonstration of the *Simple Interactions Library*. More info available at [Simple Interactions repository](https://github.com/GuuscoNL/SimpleInteractions)

You can use the code in this demo to get started with the library. I made it so you can easily see how to use the library and what you can do with it. I hope it helps!
